PAGE 29] Fabius Maximus Ι 2 5

“And such the shock of battle on this day,
And such the frenzy, whose convulsion blinds
To all save carnage, that, beneath the fray,
An earthquake rolled unheedingly away.''

25. dictator: an extraordinary magistrate appointed in time
of peril. He held his office for six months only, and was
preceded by twenty-four lictors with the fasces and axes. He
had associated with him a lieutenant called the Master of
Horse (nmgz'ster equitum), whom he usually appointed himself.
As he had no colleague‚ and was irresponsible‚ his power was
greater than that of the consul. impetum mora fregit:
i.e. he checked HannibaPs victorious career by a policy of delay.
His design was to harass Hannibal and tire him out, without
risking a decisive battle. From the successful outcome of these
tactics ‘ Fabian policy' has become proverbial.
