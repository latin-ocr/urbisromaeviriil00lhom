1. Pronunciation and Reading of the Latin. Pupils
should be taught to pronounce Latin accurately, indicating
clearly the distinction between long and short vowels. This
end may be attained in various ways. The rules of quantity
should be learned gradually with the declensions and conjuga-
tions. To acquire them in this way adds little to the pupil’s
daily task3 while for one who has been allowed to pronounce
carelessly until he enters college to attempt to reform his pro-
nunciation is an enormously difficult and discouraging labor3 it
is really well-nigh hopeless. There is a close analogy in this
respect with the use of correct English.

As not all quantities are determined by mle, but a great many
must be learned from memory and practice, it would seem a
time-saving device to provide the pupil in the earlier stages of
his reading with a text in which the quantities are marked.
Having once learned to pronounce a word correctly, and leaving
never been allowed to mispronomzce {2311oe is likely to continue
to pronounce correctly when his texts are no longer marked, and
to be led to look up for himself the quantity of words which are
new to him. It is in this belief that, throughout the book, the
quantity of all long vowels has been marked, including ‘hidden
quantities.' 2

Pupils should also be taught to read Latin aloud with such
expression that it is evident without translation whether or not

1 In correcting an error, the teacher should not repeat the faulty pronun-
ciation. If possible, let tlze pupil never lzear a Latin word mispronounced.
