PREFACE.

——000—

THE transition from the introductory Latin books to the first
Latin author, whether he be Caesar or Nepos, is undeniably¹
a difficult one, and various means of bridging the gap have
been tried. In France and Germany the V1R1 ROMAE is ex-
tensively used to meet the difficulty, and in many ways· is
admirably adapted to the purpose. It does not, indeed, prepare
the pupil especially to read Caesar, but it teaches him to read
Latin, It has the advantage over a simplified Caesar in being
full of variety and interest, and in giving the pupil a sketch of
Roman History from Romulus to Augustus in an attractive form,
which is likely to make a permanent impression on his memory.
A pupil who has read the VIRI ROMAE should have little diffi-
culty with Caesar.

The VIRI ROMAE was compiled by Charles Francois Lhomond,
Professor Emeritus of the University of Paris, who lived from
1727 to 1794. Lhomond was an enthusiastic teacher of younger
pupils, and refused many brilliant positions in order to devote
himself to his chosen work. His VIRI ROMAE was a labor of
love, especially designed to meet the difficulties of the early
stages of Latin study. It is not manufactured Latin, but a com-
pilation from Cicero, Livy, Valerius Maximus, and other Roman
writers. In his preface he tells us that he shortened sentences
which were too long, and slightly changed the order of the Latin
words in some cases; that in the selection of his material he
aimed to stimulate the curiosity and influence the character of
his pupils by giving the preference to acts of valor, of mercy‚ of
unselfishness‚ of nobility of character, and of kindness.

Of the twenty-five selections given in this edition twenty are
