Dr. J. H. Hanson, Classical Instituta», Waerville,
Me. —It is the ideal Caesar realized. That it sur-
passes all its competitors must, it seems to me, be
the universal verdict.

Richard M. Jones, Head-Master Wn. Peme
Charter Sclmol, Philadelpheia—— Kelsey's Caesar is in
my judgment the nearest approach yet made in this

country to what a school edition of an ancient classic
should be.

Dr. James M. Milne‚ Narmal Sclwol, Oneonta,
JV. V. —I am delighted with it. Its accurate schoiar.
ship, its broad scope, its illustrations, the clearness
of the text, all make it the ideal book.
