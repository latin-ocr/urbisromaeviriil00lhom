Rapid oral translation into Latin in some form should be a
daily exercise, and practice in the writing of Latin should be as
frequent as possible. Time spent in this way will tell; while
at first the amount of translation into English may be less on
account of the time given to translation into Latin, in the long
run it will surely be greater, and it will be done with greater
ease than if Latin composition be neglected or made an occa-
sional exercise only.

4. History, Geography, Mythology, and Antiquities.
In order to be prepared on his entrance to college to read the
Latin authors rapidly, easily, and appreciatively, which we may
assume to be the chief aim of the preparatory Latin course, the
student must not only have the ability to understand and trans-
late Latin of moderate difficulty at sight, but he must also have
such a knowledge of the historical environment, and of the
conditions of Roman life, as to be able to assume an attitude
of sympathy towards the author, and to look at things to some
extent from the Roman point of view3 in other words, he must
know something of ancient history and geography, of mythology,
and of the life of the Romans in all its aspects3 and the richer
this knowledge is, the easier and more interesting will be his
work. This knowledge he must, of course, acquire gradually,
and to a great extent from his Latin reading.

The selections from the VIRI ROMAE are especially adapted to
the study of Roman history. The pupil should look up all
proper names in the Vocabulary, and should consult, if possible,
the dictionaries of geography, antiquities, biography, and mythol-
ogy. It is easy to interest pupils in work of this kind, especially
if graphic illustrations are given by means of photographs‚ maps,
engravings, etc., and it is, therefore, the more to be wondered at
that most pupils who enter college, even from the best schools,
are so lamentably weak in this respect.

aged to read in English on the lines of their work in Latin. A
