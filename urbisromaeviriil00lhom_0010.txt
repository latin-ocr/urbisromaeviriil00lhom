are at the end of the book. The other five selections are pre-
pared for sight—reading, the meanings of all new words, unless
they can readily be inferred, being given at the bottom of the
page. Some exercises for translation into Latin, based on the
text, have also been provided.

The text is mainly that of the tenth edition of C. Holzer
(Stuttgart‚ 1889), with a few changes in orthography and punct-
uation. Holzer revised Lhomond's original text by following
more closely the phraseology of the Latin authors from whom
the selections are made. He also omitted some passages and
inserted others, mainly interesting anecdotes.

Throughout the book the quantity of all long vowels has been
marked. This is due to a suggestion made some years ago by
Professor William Gardner Hale of the University of Chicago
(at that time of Cornell University)‚ who has been kind enough
to read the proofs of the text and vocabulary, but with reference
to quantities only. Except in the case of a few obvious misprints‚
Lewis's ‘⁶ Latin Dictionary for Schools ⁷⁷ and ‘⁴ Elementary Latin
Dictionary” have been followed, the latter as the more recent
work being given the preference in the cases where the two
books do not agree. While reserving his opinion on several
points of acknowledged difficulty, Professor Hale has agreed
with me that it would be unwise, in a volume intended for school
use, to run the risk of confusion by differing from the books
which seem likely to be the standard for some years to come.

Thanks are also due for assistance to Professor Francis W.
Kelsey and Mr. W. K. Clement‚ of the University of Michigan.
Besides many helpful suggestions Professor Kelsey has allowed
the use of the advance sheets of his vocabulary to Cicero, from
which a few definitions have been taken.

A few Hints on Method are given on p. ix, in which the plan
of the book is more fully explained.
