T mnslalz'on into Latin 161

 

when Hannibal1 refused, Maharbal¹ told his generall that
he did not know how to use a victory. Hannibal, however,
went to Capua, which was his Cannae, for the Carthaginian
soldiers were weakened by the pleasures of a luxurious city.

Although the Romans had never suffered a greater disas-
ter than this defeat, they did not ask for peace, and would
not consent2 to ransom the prisoners which Hannibal had
taken. When ten of the prisoners had been sent to Rome,
swearing3 that they would return if they did not accomplish-
their-purpose,4 one of their number tried to free himself
from his oath by returning to the camp immediately after
his departure, as if he had forgotten something. He claimed⁵
that thus he had kept6 his oath, and would not have returned
to Hannibal had not the Romans bound⁷ him and sent⁷ him

back.
XVII. SCIPIO AFRICANUS.

It is said that Publius Scipio (when still) a boy saved his
father in the battle at the Ticinus river. For his father1 was
just on—the-point-of-falling8 into the hands of the Cartha-
ginians, when Scipio interposed.9

Afterwards when Scipio was-a-candidate-for the aedileship,
and the tribunes had opposed him because he was not yet
of the legal age, he said that if all the citizens wished to
make him aedile, he was old enough.

After the defeat at-Cannae10 he was put in command of
the soldiers who had fied to Canusium, and compelled the
young nobles who wished to leave Italy to swear that they

would not desert their country.
