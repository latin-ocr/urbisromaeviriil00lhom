T mnslatz'on into Latin 159

 

How frugally the Roman consuls lived in those times is
shown by the following story which is told of Regulus.
When he was in Africa, his slave ran away, taking with him
his farming tools.l When Regulus heard of this, and at the
same time that his command had been extended to the next
year, he was compelled to ask the senate to send some one
to Africa to succeed him, so that he might go home and
cultivate his farm himself. He said that if he did not do
this, he should not have the-means-of2 supporting his wife
and children.

XV. FABIUS MAXIMUS.

When Hannibal had captured Saguntum, the citizens of
which were allies of the Romans, the Romans sent ambassa-
dors to Carthage to3 ask that he be surrendered to them.
When they had arrived at Carthage, and the Carthaginians
gave-evasive-answers,4 Quintus Fabius, who was one of the
ambassadors, making⁵ a sold in his toga, said that he brought
them war and peace, and that they might⁶ take whichever
they wished.

When the Carthaginians had chosen war, Hannibal who
(when) a boy had sworn eternal hatred against the Romans,
crossed the Alps with a great army. Coming5 into Italy,
he defeated the Romans with great slaughter at the Trebia
river and at Lake Trasimenus. Then Quintus Fabius was
made dictator. He changed the plan of campaign] for he
did not join battle with Hannibal, but tried to wear out the
Carthaginian8 by delay. Once he nearly destroyed Hanni-
bal’s ⁸ whole army, which he had shut in a narrow pass.
