thrown into the Tiber, which, as-it-happened, had overflowed
its banks. When the flood subsided,1 the children were left
on dry-land. A she-wolf is said to have acted as their
mother, until Faustulus, the king's shepherd, noticing2 the
circumstance, gave them to his wife to bring up. When
the boys3 had grown up, Numitor told4 them who their
grandfather was, and they slew4 Amulius and restored4
Numitor to the throne. Then they resolved to found a new
city, which, (when) founded, they called Rome from the
name of Romulus. Romulus got⁴ angry with his brother,
because he laughed-at⁵ the walls of the new city, and slew4
him.
ΙΙ. ROMULUS.

1. When Romulus was⁶ king, Rome was the semblance
of a city rather than a city, because it lacked⁵ inhabitants.
2. Romulus opened an asylum in a grove near by, that the
shepherds might fiee thither for refuge. 3. In order that
Romulus and the people might have wives, they sent 4 envoys
to the neighboring states, and asked4 for an alliance and
the-right-of-intermarriage. 4. As the neighbors3 did not
listen to the embassy, Romulus concealed4 his vexation and
made4 preparation for games, and gave orders that invita-
tions be issued to them (trans. as if fleat tlte games3 be
annemzced 2‘0 tlte wezglcbors). 5. Among others the Sabines,
because they desired5 to see both the games and the new ”
city, came to ⁷ Rome with their wives and children. 6. When
the Sabines had turned their attention to the games, their
daughters, at6 a signal given by Romulus, were carried off
by the Romans.
