like F abricius, for both waged war with the Samnites and
with Pyrrhus, both lived frugally, and both contemptuously·
refused large (sums of) money, which the Samnites offered
them, because (they said) ¹ they did not wish gold, and did
not think it right to receive gifts from the enemy. And
yet Curius was accused'of embezzlement after the Samnite
war 3 but he swore that the only thing he had turned to his own
use was a wooden bowl, which he used for sacrificial offerings.
Curius would have been made consul a second time, to²
carry on war with Pyrrhus, had not the king died an igno—
minious death in3 Argos3 for he was killed with4 a tile
which was thrown from the roof of a house by a woman.

XIV. REGULUS.

The story of the brave death of Regulus is known to all.
In the second Punic war, after he had defeated the Cartha-
ginians in many battles, Regulus sailed from Sicily to Africa,
and pitched his camp at Clypea. Sallying-forth5 from Clypea,
he defeated the armies of the enemy ancl devastated their
fields, until at last they sent an ambassador to the Lace-
daemonians, to2 ask for help. The Lacedaemonians sent
them Xanthippus, a very skilful leader, who defeated and
captured Regulus. Then the Carthaginians sent Regulus to
Rome (to see) about an exchange of prisoners, after he had
sworn to return to Carthage, if he did 6 not accomplish-his-
purpose.⁷ When he came to Rome, Regulus advised the
Romans not to8 exchange prisoners, and although his rela-
tives and friends tried to detain him, he returned to Car-
thage, where he is said to have suffered a most cruel death.
