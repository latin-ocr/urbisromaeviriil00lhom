Tiberius Gracchus wished to aid them by giving them land.

the nobles of 2 wishing to make himself king, and was slain
with many of his followers.

Gaius Gracchus, not terrified by his brother⁷s death, after
obtaining the tribuneship, wished to aid the common people,
and also3 to give Roman citizenship to all the Italians. He
too was accused of being a dangerous4 citizen, and the
senate made the consul dictator in these words: ‘ Let the
consul see to it that the commonwealth suffer no harm.'
When this had been done, many of the followers of Gracchus
were slain by the nobles, and he himself was killed by a
slave in accordance with5 his own order.

XIX. MARIUS.

Gaius Marius was born at Arpinum of a humble family.
When the younger Scipio was waging war against the Span-
iards, Marius began his military life,6 and showed great valor
and enthusiasm. Then he himself waged war successfully
against Jugurtha, being⁷ chosen consul in place of Metellus,
whom he had accused of2 prolonging the war. Jugurtha
was defeated8 and captured,8 and being7 taken to Rome,
was at last put to death in prison.

A few years after this a great danger threatened Rome.
