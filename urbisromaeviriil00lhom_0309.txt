Walter A. Edwards, Prinas‘pal Ῐῇζξνῖι Sclzool‚
Rocksord, lllinois. -— Ι find the Easy Latin Lei-sons
excellently adal)·ted to the end the authors have set
themselves. The choice of material to be presented
has been judiciously made, and the sels-restraint of
the authors, following out their wish not to displaee
the teacher, cannot be too highly commended.
