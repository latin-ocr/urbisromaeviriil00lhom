‘both their minds and thoughts.' 12. erant: A. 324, ας G.
5643 H. 518, N. 1. Note the difference in the meaning of the
tenses of venit and erant5 notice also that we naturally trans-
late venit by an English pluperfect.

the omission of the conjunction. See A. 346, c3 G. '483‚ 33

Where Rome embraced her heroes? where the steep
Tarpeian — fittest goal of Treason's race,

The promontory whence the Traitor's Leap
Cured all ambition? '⁹
