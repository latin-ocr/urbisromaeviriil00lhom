T ranslatzâ€˜on into Latin 165

Rome as soon as possible to carry on war with Marius.
He defeated the partisans of Marius (trans. as if those wlw
favored Maius), for Marius himself had died in the mean-
time, and taking1 possession of the city, massacred many
thousands of the opposite faction. Then he made himself
dictator. But when he had restored power to the senate,
he resigned the dictatorship, to2 the great surprise of every-
body, and retired to his villa in the country, where he died
a few years afterwards.
