104 Notes [PAGE 5

6. Flaminem: the name of a priest devoted to a particular
deity. The flamen of Jupiter was held in high honor. Insigni
veste: the dress of the flamen consisted of the apex, a conical
cap to which a spike of olive-wood was fastened3 the toga prae-
texta (see n. to p. 11, l. 16) 3 and a laurel wreath. 7. cun-111
sella: the ‘curule chair‚⁷ or ‘chair of state‚⁷ was very plain,
resembling a common folding camp—stool, but with curved legs.
It was originally a symbol of kingly power. Under the Republic
the right of sitting on it belonged to the consuls, praetors, curule
aediles, censors, and flamens 3 also to the dictator and the magis-
ter equitum.

10. quibus sacris fulmina essent: procuranda: the falling
of a thunderbolt was regarded by the Romans as a portent, and
the direful omen was averted by propitiatory offerings. Accord-
ing to the legend, Jupiter intended that human sacrifices should
be offered on such occasions, but Numa cleverly outwitted him
and substituted others. 12. daturum esse : A. 330‚f; G. 424,
R. 3. 14. futurum esset: A. 334, ας G. 4693 H. 529, 4.
15. anone: the shield was of a peculiar oval form. On its
preservation depended the strength and prosperity of the state3
hence the precautions which Numa took to prevent its being
stolen. 18. Salios: the name (cf. salzb, ⁴ leap') means ‘ the
Leapers.' In their festival at the beginning of March they car-
ried the sacred shields through the city, and at the same time
sang a hymn to Mars and danced.

19. Kalendis: A. 2563 G. 3923 H. 429. 21. duodecim
menses: the year of Romulus had consisted of ten months.
By the arrangement ascribed to Numa, which continued until
Caesar's reform of the calendar in 46 B.C., March, May, July,
and October had 31 days, February 28, and the rest 29. This
year of 355 days was too short for the solar year, and the defi-
ciency was made up by inserting an intercalary month every
other year. This month, which varied in length at the discre-
tion of the Pantzfices, was inserted after Feb. 23.
