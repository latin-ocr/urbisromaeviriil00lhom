follow atintervczls), he fied. Then he killed the first before
the second could⁶ help his brother, and the second in the
same manner. When two of the Curiatii had been killed,
Horatius, unhurt and elated by his double victory, easily
slew the last.

Horatius, who killed his sister, because she mourned⁷ for
one of the Curiatii, to whom she was betrothed, would have
been condemned to death, if he had not appealed to the
people.

When the inhabitants—of-Veii and of-Fidenae had made

he might follow the fortune of war 3 but the Roman king
saw4 his treachery and put4 him to death.
