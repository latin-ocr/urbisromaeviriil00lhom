Translatz'on into Latin 147

 

 

XIX. Note the idiomatic use of certain adjectives: e.g.
in ε’χίνέυιῦ pbute, ‘at the end of the bridge' 3 in medic} urbe,
‘in the middle of the city '3 summus mbas, ‘the top of the
mountain ' ς primus cc’pit, ‘ he was the first to take.'

XX. Distinguish: ‘I may do this,' licet milli Ιιόί facere,
or licet lzbc faciam ‚· ‘I cam do this,' lz5c facere possum ,· ‘ I
ought to do this,' lzbcfacere (ίέὀεῦ, or oportet m? lzbc facere ,-
‘ I must do this,' m} Ιιόι· facere necesse est, necesse est ut Ιιόι·
faciam, or labe milei faciendlmz. In the past tenses the
auxiliary becomes past, and not the infinitive as in English ε
e.g. licuit milei lfflfacere.

XXI. Some verbs are used with either the infinitive or
the subjunctive with a difference of meaning,- the former
if the idea is really indirect discourse, the latter if it is
purpose: e.g. ‘ He persuades me that this is so,' milli per-
suddet lzbc ita esse ‚· ‘he persuades me to do this,' ruisti
persae—lde! nt lzbc faciam.

XXII. To write good Latin one must not only express
himself with grammatical correctness, but also idiomatically.
Many English expressions cannot be rendered literally 3 in
fact, a continuous passage of idiomatic English can hardly
ever be translated word for word into idiomatic Latin. Read
the passage carefully, and translate the thought, not the
words.
