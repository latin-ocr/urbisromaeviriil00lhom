from a wart. on his upper lip; Ovicula, ‘the Lamb,' from the mildness of
his temperament; and C ᾶηείᾶίον, from his policy in the war with Hannibal.

man when he was appointed dictator against Hannibal. He died in
203 B.C., having lived to see Hannibal leave Italy. The portion of his
-career here narrated falls between the dates given at the head of the pas-
