J. Remsen Bishop‚ Hzcglzes Hzglz Sclzool, Cin-
cinnati. —I have with the rnost eager interest gone
through the Easy Latin Lessons from cover to cover.
Long ago Ι dreamed of 3 good Latin book for be-
ginners that could be completed in one year by the
High 5011001 D grade. The otherwise satisfactory
book now in use here cannot 110 50 colnpleted3 in
my judgment that defect is fatal. The Lindsay ami
Rollsns 0311 easily be finished in one year, and omits
110 essential. Let me commend the especially elever
arrangement of the sentences, and the wise modera-
tion in vocabularies.

Frank P. Brent, Onancock Acadama, Va.—The
book is admirably graded‚ and clearly presents just
those things that should be learned by a pupil during
the first year in Latin. We are using it with marked
success.
