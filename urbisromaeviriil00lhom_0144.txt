Page 30. 3. Salinator: Cicero tells us that M. Livius
Salinator commanded Tarentum when it was taken by Hannibal,
but he is undoubtedly in error. Livy gives the commander's
name as M. Livius Macatus. The name Salinator was first
given in ridicule, because M. L1vius imposed a tax on salt, but
it became the regular surname of the family.

4. in arcem: like most ancient cities, Tarentum had a strong-
hold or arx, elevated (in the case of Tarentum only slightly)
above the rest of the city, and strongly fortified. Here Livius
held out until Fabius retook the city. Ι7. leve dictu: 6 insig-

chosen by himself, though the choice had to be ratified by the
senate. The ίὲἕᾶίῖ were usually men of considerable military

experience. They aided the general with their advice, but
had no independent power.
