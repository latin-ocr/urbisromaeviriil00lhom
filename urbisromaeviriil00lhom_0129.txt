VII. SERVIUS TULLIUS, THE SIXTH KING OF THE
ROMANS.

Page 12. 1. Servius Tullius: according to the universal
tradition Servius was of Latin origin. The story of his career is
full of marvels, and cannot be regarded as history. The tradition
may point to a successful attempt of the Latins to throw off the
yoke of the Etruscans, who, however, afterwards reconquered
them. The constitution ascribed to Servius goes back to very
early times, it endured with some modifications until the fall of
the Republic.
