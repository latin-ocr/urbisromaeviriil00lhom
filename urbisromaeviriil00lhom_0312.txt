H. C. Missimer, Principczl Htsgrh School, Eric,
Pcz.—-It is very easy to see that Comstock's First
Latin Book is the work of a thorough teacher, who
has had actual experience in the class-room with the
difficulties which beginners in Latin usually meet.
Its classification and methods are thorough and com·
plete. The language is so clear, so simple, and
school—like, that the dullest pupil, if he read care-
fully, should understand without further explanation.
ΜΓ. Comstock has hit the nail on the head. He
knows just what and just how much grammar is
needed for good, clean work. We have had Leigh-
ton and Jones,—both good3 but we like Comstock
more, because it is better.
