Ι 44 Exercz'ses for

the ablative absolute, or by a clause introduced by cum,
ubi, etc, Do not use the abl. abs. when it may be replaced
by a participle agreeing with the subject or object of the
verb: e.g. ‘Having put the babes in a trough, he threw
them into the Tiber,' parvulbs alveb iquszffis in Tiberim
abz'Zcit (p. 1, 1. 7).

II. The present participle is often used loosely in Eng-
lish. It must be translated into Latin by a perfect participle
or an equivalent (see Ι), unless its action is strictly contem-
poraneous with that of the verb on which the participle
depends: e.g. ‘Faustulus, noticing the circumstance, took
them to his cottage,' Faustulus, ἡ auimadversd, ebs tulit in
casam (p. 1, 1. 14).

ΙΙΙ. Τ611565 are generally used more accurately in Latin
than in English. We say, for instance, ‘ If he comes, I shall
see him' 3 the Latin more accurately says, si veniet or si
vZnerit (fut. perf.). In translating into Latin, determine the
exact relations of time, and use the corresponding tenses.
In indirect discourse the time must be determined with
reference to that of the verb which introduces the indirect
discourse. In order to do this, try to reproduce the speak-
er's words : e.g. ‘They swore that if they did not accomplish
their purpose, they would return to the camp'3 they said,
si nbn impetraverimus (fut. perf.), iu castra redibimus ,·
hence, τ’ῖιγᾶῖνένῑιηί s'e‘, si 72572 impetrdssent, in castra esse
redz'tl‘crbs (p. 33, 1. 18).

IV. Remember how indirect discourse is expressed.
Read carefully A. 336—3393 G. 651-6643 H. 522—527.
While reading Latin, carefully notice the moods and tenses
in all indirect quotations. With verbs meaning ‘to promise,’
the fut. inf. with subject accusative is commonly used.
