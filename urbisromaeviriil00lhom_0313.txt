sessor Kelsey has again shown how admirably he
can meet the wants of good teachers. But his edi-
tion of Ovid does more than this. We have all
read the stereotyped testimonial which tells that the
author has satisfied a long felt want. But a really
good text-book sho'uld inspire as well as gratify an
appetite. The book that merely chronicles the best
system in vogue at the time of its publication, adds
little to the history of teaching. This edition of
Ovid must quicken the poetic sense of even the most
prosaie teachers. I cannot help feeling that many a
pupil will thank Professor Kelsey for having shown
how the same themes that inspired Ovid still live in
our own English classics. Hitherto we have had to
send our boys to Bulfinch for such proofs. Now we
have had given to us a manual of mythology, a
scholarly edition, a Latin classic, and an abundance
of poetic inspiration, all at once. Ovid did not write
to exhibit the grammatical usages of his day, or to
help make philologists3 and Professor Kelsey has
not made the mistake of supposing that his verses
are best used when they are made to serve such
purposes.
