Ι. THE BEGINNINGS OF ROME.

THE legends of the founding of Rome and of the reigns of the seven
kings, although believed in by the Romans themselves, and generally ac-
cepted in modern times until the publication os the first volume of Nie-
buhr’s History of Rome, in 1811, cannot be accepted as history. They are
largely aetiologc'cal, that is, many of the stories have been invented to
explain customs and institutions which were already in existence at the
beginning of the historica] period; and many of them may be traced to
Greek sources. The dates were traditional with the Romans themselves,
and are not to be relied on. According to Lewis (On tlte Credibilily of
Early Roman History), a trustworthy history of Rome does not begin until
the war with Pyrrhus. In this statement he undoubtedly goes too far; but
the history of the period before the destruction of the city by the Gauls in
390 B.C., while it narrates some historical facts, cannot be accepted as gen-
uine in the form in which it has come down to us.

For an‘excellent discussion of the historical value of these legends, see
Ihne's Early Rome.
