EXERCISES FOR TRANSLATION INTO
LATIN.

THE following Exercises have been prepared because it is believed that
daily practice in translating English into Latin should not cease, as is too
often the case, when the pupil finishes his first Latin book, but should be
continued at least throughout his preparatory course.

The sentences are intended for rapid oral work, to increase the pupil's
vocabulary, to train him in expressing himself fluently in Latin, giving
instantly the equivalent of each English word, and to cultivate the habit
of carefully noting the meaning of all Latin words while reading. This
habit is the only preparation needed for work of this kind. Owing to lack
of space, the sentences are merely suggestive, and are confined to the first
few passages. It is strongly recommended that the teacher supplement
them, or replace them by exercises of his own, and that practice in this oral
work be a regular part of each recitation. Other exercises of the kind are
suggested in the HINTs ΟΝ METHoD on pp. ix fol.

The continuous passages may be written or recited orally, with or with-
out previous preparation, as the teacher prefers. It is suggested that when
they are written, the pupil mark the quantity of the long vowels in all the
passageS.

Some of the errors to which beginners are especially inclined are guarded
against in the following HINTS, to which references are made by Roman
numerals (VI, X). References are also occasionally made to the pages and
lines of the Text (as p. 10, 1. 6), to call attention to words or phrases which
may have been forgotten. A few grammatical references are given, which
may be explained by the teacher as they occur. Words between parenthe-
ses are to be omitted in translating into Latin.

active participle. With other verbs, ‘having done this'
and similar expressions must be translated into Latin by
