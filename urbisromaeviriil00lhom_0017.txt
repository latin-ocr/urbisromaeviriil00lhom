stirring poem or an interesting historical novel will often make
an impression, when the formal work os the class-room has failed
to do so, and most young people are readily interested in reading
of this kind. Especially adapted to the purpose are Macaulay's
‘Lays of Ancient Rome' and parts of Byron's ‘Childe Harold.'
For a selected list of historical novels see Kelsey's ‘Fifty Topics
in Roman Antiquities,'1 pp. 69, 70.
