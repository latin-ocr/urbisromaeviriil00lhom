they understand the meaning of what they have read. They
should acquire the habit of doing this wzllzont translating, even
in the mind. Reading the Latin, therefore, should not be an
occasional exercise, but a regular and important part of each
and every recitation, and of the pupil’s preparation for recitation.
In this connection, as well as an important aid in writing Latin,
the practice of committing to memory selected passages of Latin,
and reciting them with correctness and expression, is a most
helpful exercise which is too often wholly neglected.

The VIRI ROMAE is particularly rich in anecdotes which may
be used in this way.

2. Translation. Translation into English should be insisted
on. To comprehend the meaning of a Latin sentence, and to
express that meaning in idiomatic English, are two distinct and
equally valuable arts. They should be made as distinct as
possible. The pupil should learn to grasp the meaning of a
Latin sentence in tlte orzginal, following tlte order of tlte Latin
words. He should also learn to express that meaning in idio-
matic English. A literal translation should never be allowed,
unless it happen to be also idiomatic. The charge is often
seriously made that the study of Latin ruins one's English style,
and a real danger undoubtedly exists. If, however, the pupil be
trained from the outset to think in Latin, bad English need
never be used to explain the meaning of difficult sentences.

The ear should be trained as well as the eye. Therefore the
pupil should occasionally be called on to translate, without the
text before him, passages read to him by his teacher. Often
pupils who have acqulred some facility in translating are unable
to comprehend simple sentences when read to them, or even to
write them in Latin from dictation.

Pupils should acquire the ability to understand and trans-
late any Latin in which the words and the constructions are
familiar to them3 that is to say, to translate at sight. To this
end they should master all new constructions, and should learn
